# Salifort Motor : Employee Retention Project

**This project is a part of Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate course.**

## Overview
Salifort Motors is seeking a method to use employee data to gauge what makes them leave the company.

## Issues
Salifort Motors seeks to improve employee retention and answer the question: Whatâ€™s likely to make the employee leave the company?

## Response
Since the variable I am seeking to predict is categorical, I could build either a logistic regression or a tree-based machine learning model. The random forest model slightly outperforms the decision tree model.

## Methodology
** PACE framework**

### Pace : Plan stage
- Understand the business scenario and define the problem
- Data exploration and data cleaning

### pAce : Anaylze stage
- Data exploration and data cleaning
- Determine which models are most appropriate
- Confirm model assumptions
- Evaluate model results 

### paCe : Construct stage
- Determine which models are most appropriate
- Construct the model

### pacE : Execute stage
- Interpret results and share actionable steps with stakeholders

## Impact
This model helps predict whether an employee will leave and identify which factors are most influential. These insights can help HR make decisions to improve employee retention.

## Insights 
- Cap the number of projects that employees can work on.
- Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for at least four years, or conduct further investigation about why four-    year tenured employees are so dissatisfied.
- Either reward employees for working longer hours, or don't require them to do so.
- If employees aren't familiar with the company's overtime pay policies, inform them about this. If the expectations around workload and time off aren't explicit, make them clear.
- Hold company-wide and within-team discussions to understand and address the company work culture, across the board and in specific contexts.
- High evaluation scores should not be reserved for employees who work 200+ hours per month. Consider a proportionate scale for rewarding employees who contribute more/put in more effort.
